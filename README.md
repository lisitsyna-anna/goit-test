# Features

User cards display information about each user, including avatar, number of
tweets, and number of followers. By clicking on the Follow button, the text
changes to Following, the button color changes, and the number of followers
increases by one. The number of followers remains the same even after the page
is refreshed, and the button remains in the Following state with the
corresponding color. When you click the Following button again, the text and
color change to the initial state, and the number of followers decreases by one.
